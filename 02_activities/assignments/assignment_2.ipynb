    "I was assigned question 3 which is straightforward and easy to understand in terms of the ouput required. However, getting to the solution required quite a bit of mental gymnastics in terms of having to create another list to compare it with the input list to find the missing numbers. It's also quite eye opening to see alternative solutions that involves working with sums and using set membership to solve the problem. It really goes to show there are multiple approaches to a LeetCode problem, which often resembles that of solving a math question. I personally find the question my partner is assigned to more difficult even though I understood that recursive DS has to be leveraged here, the idea of a helper function being called in a main function didn't occur to me that quickly. Once I grasp the idea of the helper function, the rest just naturally fall into place. I appreciate my partner's detailed write up of an alternative solution as it provides a clear writeup of how the code would come together and function as a whole. In general, I find the approach outlined in the assignment a useful framework for solving difficult coding questions. Starting from restating the problem and coming up with examples prior to coding the solution definitely helps a lot with structuring my thoughts. I will use this approach to tackle future coding problems as well."
